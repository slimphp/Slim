# Slim Framework for PHP 5

Slim is a micro framework for PHP 5 that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful RESTful web applications and APIs. Slim is easy to use for both beginners and professionals. Slim favors cleanliness over terseness and common cases over edge cases. Its interface is simple, intuitive, and extensively documented â€” both online and in the code itself. Thank you for choosing Slim for your next project. I think you're going to love it.

## "Hello World" application (PHP >= 5.3)

The Slim Framework for PHP 5 supports anonymous functions. This is the preferred method to define Slim application routes. This example assumes you have setup URL rewriting with your web server (see below).

```php
<?php
require 'Slim/Slim.php';
$app = new Slim();
$app->get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
});
$app->run();
```

## "Hello World" application (PHP < 5.3)

If you are running PHP < 5.3, the second argument to the application's `get()` instance method is the name of a callable function instead of an anonymous function. This example assumes you have setup URL rewriting with your web server (see below).

```php
<?php
require 'Slim/Slim.php';
$app = new Slim();
$app->get('/hello/:name', 'hello');
function hello($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}
$app->run();
```

## Get Started

### Install Slim

Download the Slim Framework for PHP 5 and unzip the downloaded file into your virtual host's public directory. Slim will work in a sub-directory, too.

### Setup your webserver

#### Apache

Ensure the `.htaccess` and `index.php` files are in the same public-accessible directory. The `.htaccess` file should contain this code:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]

#### Nginx

Your nginx configuration file should contain this code (along with other settings you may need) in your `location` block:

    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;

This assumes that Slim's `index.php` is in the root folder of your project (www root).

#### lighttpd ####

Your lighttpd configuration file should contain this code (along with other settings you may need). This code requires lighttpd >= 1.4.24.

    url.rewrite-if-not-file = ("^" => "/index.php")

This assumes that Slim's `index.php` is in the root folder of your project (www root).

### Build Your Application

Your Slim application will be defined in `index.php`. First, `require` the Slim Framework:

```php
require 'Slim/Slim.php';
```

Next, initialize the Slim application:

```php
$app = new Slim();
```

Next, define your application's routes:

```php
$app->get('/hello/:name', function ($name) {
    echo "Hello $name";
});
```

Finally, run your Slim application:

```php
    $app->run();
```

For more information about building an application with the Slim Framework, refer to the [official documentation](http://github.com/codeguy/Slim/wiki/Slim-Framework-Documentation).
