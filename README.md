Slim is a PHP micro-framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Slim.

```bash
$ composer require slim/slim "^3.0"
```

This will install Slim and all required dependencies. Slim requires PHP 5.5.0 or newer.

## Usage

Create an index.php file with the following contents:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new Slim\App();

$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($request, $response, $args) {
    return $response->write("Hello, " . $args['name']);
});

$app->run();
```

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Going to http://localhost:8000/hello/world will now display "Hello, world".

For more information on how to configure your web server, see the [Documentation](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/start/web-servers.html).

## Tests

To execute the test suite, you'll need phpunit.

```bash
$ phpunit
```
