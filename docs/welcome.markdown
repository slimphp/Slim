# Slim Framework for PHP 5 Documentation [welcome]

Slim is a micro framework for PHP 5 that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful RESTful web applications and APIs. Slim is easy to use for both beginners and professionals. Slim favors cleanliness over terseness and common cases over edge cases. Its interface is simple, intuitive, and extensively documented - both here and within the code itself. If you need further explanation about a certain class or method, don't hesitate to open up the source code. Thank you for choosing Slim for your next project. I think you're going to love it.
