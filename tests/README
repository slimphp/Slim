Slim Framework Unit Tests

Follow the directions below to run the Slim Framework unit tests. You'll need the latest version of PHPUnit. To save development time, these unit tests require PHP >= 5.3. However, the Slim Framework itself requires only PHP >= 5.2.

1. Install the latest version of PHPUnit
Visit http://www.phpunit.de/ for installation instructions.

2. Run PHPUnit
From the filesystem directory that contains the `tests` directory, you may run all unit tests or specific unit tests. Here are several examples. The '$>' in the examples below is your command prompt.

To run all tests:
$> phpunit tests

To run all HTTP-related tests:
$> phpunit tests/Http

To run only the HTTP Request tests:
$> phpunit tests/Http/RequestTest
