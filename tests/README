Slim Framework Unit Tests

I use PHPUnit 3.5.13. To run these unit tests on your system, follow the directions below. To save development time, these unit tests currently require PHP >= 5.3. However, the Slim Framework itself only requires PHP >= 5.1.

To run these unit tests:

1. Install PHPUnit
Visit http://www.phpunit.de/ for installation instructions.

2. Run PHPUnit
From the filesystem directory that contains the `tests` directory, you may run all unit tests or specific unit tests. Here are several examples. The '$>' in the examples below is your command prompt.

To run all tests:
$> phpunit tests

To run all HTTP-related tests:
$> phpunit tests/Http

To run only the HTTP Request tests:
$> phpunit tests/Http/RequestTest
