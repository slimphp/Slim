# How to upgrade

* [2288] - If you were using `determineRouteBeforeAppMiddleware`, you need to add the `Middleware\RoutingMiddleware` middleware to your application just before your call `run()` to maintain the previous behaviour.
* [2254] - You need to add the `Middleware\ContentLengthMiddleware` middleware if you want Slim to add the Content-Length header this automatically.
* [2290] - Slim no longer has a Container so you need to supply your own. As a
  result, you need to customise Slim's error handlers or router, etc. then you
  must use `App`'s `set` methods. Similarly, if you were relying on request or
  response being in the container, then you need to either set them to a
  container yourself, or refactor. Also, `App`'s `__call()` method has been
  removed, so accessing a container property via $app->key_name() no longer
  works.
* [2166] - You need to add the `Middleware\OutputBuffering` middleware to capture echo'd or var_dump'd output from your code.
* [2098] - You need to add the App's router to the container for a straight upgrade. If you've created your own router factory in the container though, then you need to set it into the $app.
* [2102] - You must inject custom route invocation strategy with `$app->getRouter()->setDefaultInvocationStrategy($myStrategy)`
