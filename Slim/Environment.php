     * This method adheres to the Rack (Ruby) specification. Descriptions below are
     * paraphrased from <http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html> for consistency.
     *
     * REQUEST_METHOD
     *     The current HTTP request method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD. Cannot be empty.
     * SCRIPT_NAME
     *     The initial portion of the request URL's "path" that corresponds to the physical directory
     *     in which the Slim application is installed --- so that the application knows its virtual "location".
     *     This may be an empty string if the application is installed in the top-level of the
     *     public document root directory. This will never have a trailing slash.
     * PATH_INFO
     *     The remaining portion of the request URL's "path" that determines the "virtual" location of the
     *     HTTP request's target resource within the Slim application's context. This will always have
     *     a leading slash; it may or may not have a trailing slash.
     * QUERY_STRING
     *     The part of the HTTP request's URL after, but not including, the "?". May be empty, but is always required!
     * SERVER_NAME
     *     When combined with the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO, this can be used to create a fully qualified URL
     *     to an application resource. However, if HTTP_HOST is present, that should be used instead of this.
     *     This is required and may never be an empty string.
     * SERVER_PORT
     *     When combined with the SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO, this can be used to create a fully qualified URL
     *     to any application resource. This is required and may never be an empty string.
     * HTTP_*
     *     Variables matching the HTTP request headers sent by the client with the HTTP request. The existence
     *     of these variables correspond with those sent in the current HTTP request. These variables' names
     *     will NOT be prefixed with HTTP_.
     * slim.url_scheme
     *     Will be "http" or "https" depending on the HTTP request URL.
     * slim.input
     *     Will be a string representing raw request data sent with the HTTP request. If raw request data is
     *     unavailable (i.e. with a GET request), this will be an empty string.
     * slim.errors
     *     Must always be a writable resource; by default this is a write-only resource handle to php://stderr
