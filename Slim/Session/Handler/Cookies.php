/**
 * Session Cookie Handler
 *
 * This class is used as an adapter for PHP's $_SESSION handling.
 * Session data will be written to and read from signed, encrypted
 * cookies. If the current PHP installation does not have the `mcrypt`
 * extension, session data will be written to signed but unencrypted
 * cookies; however, the session cookies will still be secure and will
 * become invalid if manually edited after set by PHP.
