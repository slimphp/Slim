/**
 * Stream Data
 *
 * This class will stream raw data  to the HTTP client.
 * You may control how the data is streamed by passing an associative array
 * of settings as the second argument to the constructor. They are:
 *
 * 1) buffer_size - The size of each streamed data chunk
 * 2) time_limit - The amount of time allowed to stream the data
 *
 * By default, PHP will run indefinitely until the data streaming is complete
 * or the client closes the HTTP connection. The chunk size is 8192 bytes
