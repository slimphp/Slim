/**
 * Stream File
 *
 * This class will stream a file from your file system to the HTTP client.
 * You may control how the file is streamed by passing an associative array
 * of settings as the second argument to the constructor. They are:
 *
 * 1) buffer_size - The size of each streamed file chunk
 * 2) time_limit - The amount of time allowed to stream the file
 *
 * By default, PHP will run indefinitely until the file streaming is complete
 * or the client closes the HTTP connection. The chunk size is 8192 bytes
