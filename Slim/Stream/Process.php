/**
 * Stream Process Output
 *
 * This class will stream process output to the HTTP client.
 * You may control how the output is streamed by passing an associative array
 * of settings as the second argument to the constructor. They are:
 *
 * 1) time_limit - The amount of time allowed to stream the data
 *
 * By default, PHP will run indefinitely until the output streaming is complete
 * or the client closes the HTTP connection. Unlike Slim_Stream_File,
 * this class will stream output line by line as it is returned from
 * the system process.
